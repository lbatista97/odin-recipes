            <h2>Description</h2>
                 <p>While Lasagna is well known as a <strong>traditional
                Italian dish</strong>, this recipe only calls for everyday
                ingredients you can find with your kitchen. We will be making
                this dish <em>from scratch</em>, meaning that we will makes some
                sacrifices in the authenticity department for the sake of convenience.
                This is a homemade recipe I learned from my Italian-American friend's
                mother. </p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
                        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
                    </ol>
